If the satellite is in a circular orbit, the force of Gravity acting on it is balanced by the fictitious centripetal force due to its velocity.

Fg = GMm/r^2

where M is Earths mass, m is the satellite mass, and r is the radius of the satellites orbit
(and gravity constant G)

Fc = mv^2/r

Fg = Fc

GMm/r^2 = mv^2/r

(assuming that the mass of the Earth is so much larger than that of the satellite that the center of mass for the two objects is centered on the Earth)

GM = r*v^2

GM/(r^3) = (v/r)^2

given that angular speed w = v/r

GM/(r^3) = w^2

and since angular speed relates to period like w = 2*pi/T (where T is period)

GM/(r^3) = 4*(pi^2)/(T^2)

r^3 = GM(T^2)/(4*(pi^2) )

and taking the cube root we get

r = (GM(T^2)/(4*(pi^2) )^1/3

if h is the height above the Earths surface, r = h + Re

where Re is the Earths radius

so h = r - Re
